# ovuse
Ovuse (formerly known as Layouts) is a WPF-inspired javascript UI framework that let you write web application that runs on any modern browsers.

Ovuse borrows many ideas from WPF like Xaml, Dependency Properties, Binding, DataContext, DataTemplate, Page Routing etc but, like Avalonia (https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) does in desktop/mobile environments, make easier styling controls using standard CSS.

Ovuse comes from my personal development experiences with Layouts (https://github.com/adospace/layouts): with it I've successfully developed a complex dashboard application enjoying many powerful features like Xaml and Binding. Layouts was written specifically for Visual Studio users (so it's released as a nuget package) while Ovuse is released as npm package (yarn in future too?) and written entirely with Typescript in Visual Studio Code.

Ovuse is best suited for Single Page Applications (SAP) and supports natively MVM pattern.
